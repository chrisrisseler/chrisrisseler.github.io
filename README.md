# Chris Risseler's Personal Page

Chris Risseler's Personal Page is a webpage that allows users to see more information about me, to see my portfolio, and contact me if needed. It includes three seperate pages, with a navbar to help you navagate between them. As I add more to my portfolio, I will be updating the images there.
